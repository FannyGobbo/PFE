--- How was basic-pitch trained? ---
Harmonic CNN = NN archi to detect melodies
Constant-Q Transform = similar to fourier transform, puts the signal into 
frequency "bins"
Harmonic CQT = The Harmonic CQT (HCQT) [13]
is a transformation of the CQT which aligns harmonically-related
frequencies along a third dimension, allowing small convolutional
kernels to capture harmonically-related information
